# This is the PCIE x1 to MXM 3.0 adapter
It is very basic and intended for simple use. You are limited by the bandwith available on the 1 PCIE lane.
This model contains an HDMI port and a toggle to enable the presence of a dummy VGA monitor.
### Version 1.0 is available here, but it is the first iteration and may have issues. 
Feel free to reach out and/or create an issue on this github to report problems.
You may also contribute your changes to this project if you want to improve it.
### This adapter can be built by a PCB fabrication company
A PCB house like JLCPCB can manufacture and even assemble this device for you if you want.
Currently, a Bill of Materials list is not available, but will be added soon.
Only the KiCAD files are included right now, which are accessible by the free and open-source KiCAD EDA software.
