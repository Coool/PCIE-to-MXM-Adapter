# PCIE to MXM Adapter
This adapter/card allows you to plug an MXM 3.0/3.1 graphics card into a desktop PCI Express port.
There's multiple use cases for this, including MXM card testing, repair, basic computer use, gaming, light workstation use, and more.
This adapter design has been made publicly viewable for educational purposes. 
I made this desicion because of the very high prices that these MXM adapters usually go for online, 
as well as to allow the general public to understand how MXM cards can be interfaced 
with computers to function.
As always, feel free to create issues on this repository and contribute to the project.
