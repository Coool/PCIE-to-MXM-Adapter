# PCIE to MXM Adapter
This adapter/card allows you to plug an MXM 3.0 graphics card into a desktop PCIE port.
There's multiple use cases for this, including MXM card testing, repair, basic computer use, gaming, light workstation use, and more.
These adapter designs are all opensource for your convenience. I made this desicion because of the very high prices that these MXM adapters usually go for online.
As always, feel free to create issues on this repository and contribute to the project!
